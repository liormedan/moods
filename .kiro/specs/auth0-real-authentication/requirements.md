# Requirements Document - Auth0 Real Authentication

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current demo authentication system with a fully functional Auth0 implementation. Each user will have their own secure account with personalized data isolation, ensuring privacy and security for all mental health tracking data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Auth0 Account Setup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set up a real Auth0 account, so that users can authenticate securely with industry-standard OAuth protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Auth0 THEN the system SHALL create a new Auth0 tenant with proper configuration
2. WHEN configuring the application THEN Auth0 SHALL be set up with correct callback URLs for localhost and production
3. WHEN setting up social logins THEN the system SHALL support Google and email/password authentication methods
4. IF the Auth0 setup is complete THEN the system SHALL have valid client credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Domain)

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable configuration, so that Auth0 credentials are managed securely across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL replace demo credentials with real Auth0 credentials
2. WHEN setting up development environment THEN localhost:3000 SHALL be configured as allowed callback URL
3. WHEN preparing for production THEN environment variables SHALL be documented for deployment
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: User Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely, so that I can access my personal mental health data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the app THEN they SHALL be able to sign up with email/password or Google
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL be redirected to their personal dashboard
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN they SHALL be completely signed out and redirected to the login page
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see appropriate error messages
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL not be able to access protected routes

### Requirement 4: Data Isolation Per User

**User Story:** As a user, I want my mental health data to be completely private, so that only I can see my mood entries, insights, and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL only see their own mood entries
2. WHEN a user creates new data THEN it SHALL be associated with their unique user ID
3. WHEN querying the database THEN all queries SHALL be filtered by the authenticated user's ID
4. WHEN a user accesses API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication and authorization
5. IF a user tries to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information, so that I can keep my account details up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first logs in THEN their profile SHALL be automatically created in the database
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the changes SHALL be saved to both Auth0 and local database
3. WHEN displaying user information THEN the system SHALL show the user's name and email from Auth0
4. IF user profile data is missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with default values

### Requirement 6: API Security

**User Story:** As a system, I want all API endpoints to be secured, so that only authenticated users can access their own data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL verify the user's authentication token
2. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL extract user information from the Auth0 session
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be scoped to the authenticated user's data only
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN API endpoints SHALL return 401 Unauthorized status
5. IF a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be redirected to login

### Requirement 7: Migration from Demo Data

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to cleanly migrate from demo authentication, so that the transition is smooth and no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating authentication THEN existing demo data SHALL be preserved for testing
2. WHEN new users sign up THEN they SHALL start with empty data sets
3. WHEN testing the system THEN demo data SHALL still be accessible for development purposes
4. IF migration issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during authentication processes, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the user SHALL see loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL see success feedback
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see specific error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the user SHALL see appropriate retry options
5. IF the user's session expires THEN they SHALL be notified and redirected to login

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully sign up and log in with Auth0
- Each user sees only their own data
- All API endpoints are properly secured
- The application works seamlessly with real authentication
- No security vulnerabilities in the authentication flow
- Smooth user experience during login/logout processes
