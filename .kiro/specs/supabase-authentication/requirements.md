# Requirements Document - Supabase Authentication

## Introduction

This feature will implement Supabase authentication to replace the current demo system. Supabase provides a simple, secure authentication solution with built-in user management and database integration, ensuring each user has isolated access to their mental health data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Supabase Project Setup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set up a Supabase project, so that users can authenticate securely with a managed service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Supabase THEN the system SHALL create a new Supabase project
2. WHEN configuring authentication THEN Supabase SHALL support email/password and Google authentication
3. WHEN setting up the database THEN Supabase SHALL provide PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
4. IF the Supabase setup is complete THEN the system SHALL have valid API keys and database URL

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Supabase configuration, so that the application connects securely to Supabase services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the system SHALL use Supabase URL and anon key
2. WHEN setting up development environment THEN localhost SHALL be configured for Supabase auth
3. WHEN preparing for production THEN environment variables SHALL be documented
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: User Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and log in easily, so that I can access my personal mental health data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the app THEN they SHALL be able to sign up with email/password
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL be redirected to their personal dashboard
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN they SHALL be completely signed out
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see clear error messages
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN they SHALL not access protected routes

### Requirement 4: Data Isolation Per User

**User Story:** As a user, I want my mental health data to be completely private, so that only I can see my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL only see their own data
2. WHEN a user creates new data THEN it SHALL be associated with their Supabase user ID
3. WHEN querying the database THEN all queries SHALL be filtered by the authenticated user's ID
4. WHEN accessing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify Supabase authentication
5. IF a user tries to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 5: Supabase Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I want to integrate with Supabase seamlessly, so that authentication and data management work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first logs in THEN their profile SHALL be created in the local database
2. WHEN using Supabase client THEN it SHALL handle authentication tokens automatically
3. WHEN making database queries THEN Supabase RLS SHALL enforce user isolation
4. IF Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 6: API Security

**User Story:** As a system, I want all API endpoints secured with Supabase auth, so that only authenticated users access their data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify Supabase JWT tokens
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL extract user ID from Supabase session
3. WHEN executing database queries THEN they SHALL be scoped to the authenticated user
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN API SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
5. IF a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be redirected to login

## Success Criteria

- Users can sign up and log in with Supabase
- Each user sees only their own data
- All API endpoints are secured
- Supabase handles authentication seamlessly
- Simple setup and maintenance
- Good user experience
